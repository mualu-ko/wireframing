# Introduction to Wireframing

## What is Wireframing?
Wireframing is the process of creating a simplified, visual blueprint of a digital product such as a website or mobile application. It focuses on layout, structure, and functionality rather than colors, images, or final design details. Wireframes typically use basic shapes, lines, and placeholders to represent content and interactive elements.

## Why is Wireframing Important?
Wireframing is a critical step in the design process because it:
- **Clarifies ideas**: Helps designers and stakeholders visualize the structure before investing time in high-fidelity design.  
- **Improves collaboration**: Provides a shared reference point for teams to discuss functionality and user flow.  
- **Saves time and cost**: Identifies issues early, reducing the need for costly changes later in development.  
- **Enhances usability**: Allows for quick testing of navigation and layout decisions with users before final design.  

By focusing on structure first, wireframing ensures that the final product is both **user-friendly** and **aligned with project goals**.
